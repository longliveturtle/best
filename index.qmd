Conquest of Paradise

Song by Dana Winner ‧ 2002

```
There shines a light in the heart of man
Defies the dead of the night
A beam that glows within every soul
Like wings of hope taking flight
A sunny day, when a baby's born
The little things that we say
A special sparkle in someone's eye
Simple gifts every day
Somewhere there's a paradise
Where everyone finds release
It's here on earth and between your eyes
A place we all find our peace
Come, open your heart
Reach for the stars
Believe your own power
Now, here in this place
Here on this earth
This is the hour
It's just a place we call paradise
Each of us has his own
It has no name, no, it has no price
It's just a place we call home
A dream that reaches beyond the stars
The endless blue of the skies
Forever wondering who we are
Forever questioning why
Come, open your heart
Reach for the stars
Believe your own power
Now, here in this place
Here on this earth
This is the hour
There shines a light in the heart of man
Defies the dead of the night
A beam that glows within every soul
Like wings of hope taking flight
Like wings of hope taking flight
```
